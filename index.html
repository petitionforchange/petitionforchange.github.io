<h2><a href="http://chng.it/mK5k9vb5c6" target="_blank">Free Muslims from Chinese Concentration Camps</a></h2>
<p>The Chinese government has been putting Muslims in the country into concentration camps since 2017 where they are tortured, forced to eat pork/drink alcohol (which goes against their religion), and made to denounce Islam.</p>

<h2><a href="http://chng.it/6YSjm2p4rX" target="_blank">Save the USPS</a></h2>
<p>The USPS is experiencing financial difficulties. USPS is many people's only way of sending mail to their loved ones/lawyers/other important individuals and also transports mail-in voting. The USPS is a public service, not a business. </p>

<h2><a href="http://chng.it/d7mDBByBZR" target="_blank">Remove the DHS from Portland</a></h2>
<p>The Department of Home Security has been capturing BLM protesters in Portland, Oregon and putting them into unmarked vans (a thing we usually refer to as kidnapping). The DHS also likely plans to utilize this type of force more around the US in the future if they are not stopped.</p>

<br></br>
