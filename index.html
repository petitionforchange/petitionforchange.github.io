<h1>Petition For Change</h1>

<h2><a href="https://www.change.org/p/chicago-police-department-chicago-police-should-be-charged-with-for-killing-13-year-old-adam-toledo-he-was-unarmed" target="_blank">Justice for Adam Toledo</a></h2>
<p>Adam Toledo, a 13 year old boy, was fatally shot by a Chicago police officer. Based on footage recently released by the Chicago police department, Toledo was unarmed and had his arms up. However, Toledo was murdered anyway.</p>
  
<h2><a href="https://www.change.org/p/justice-for-daunte-wright?source_location=discover_feed" target="_blank">Justice for Daunte Wright</a></h2>
<p>Daunte Wright was pulled over because he had an air freshener in the wrong place. While the police had him pulled over, one of the officers shot him, leaving him for dead.</p>
  
<h2><a href="https://www.change.org/p/resignation-of-jay-baker?redirect=false" target="_blank">Make Jay Parker Resign</a></h2>
<p>Jay Parker is a police captain in Cherokee County. He said that the man who recently killed 8 Asian women was only "having a bad day" and needed to release "temptation." He was also caught engaging with/posting racist posts on social media.</p>
  
<h2><a href="https://action.aclu.org/petition/stop-federal-executions" target="_blank">Abolish the Death Penalty</a></h2>
<p>In theory, the death penalty is reserved for only the worst criminals, those who have committed truly heinous acts. However, this is often not the case and many times, inmates are placed on death row unfairly. There is no humane method of execution.</p>
  
<h2><a href="https://www.change.org/p/united-nations-support-the-endsars-protest" target="_blank">End SARS</a></h2>
<p>SARS is a police faction in Nigeria that is notorious for severe and unnecessary police brutality.</p>
  
<br/>
  
<h2><a href="https://www.change.org/p/u-s-congress-abolish-the-electoral-college-9b343584-05cb-4a67-862f-24ffb7e31c2e" target="_blank">Abolish the Electoral College</a></h2>
<p>The electoral college was initially founded because when the US was first established, rich people wanted a way to overturn poor people's votes. They considered this avoiding "mob rule". Under the electoral college, some people's votes are weightier than others. This is unfair, as the United States is supposed to be a place where everyone's vote means just as much as the next person's. Because some people's votes weight more than others, there can be situations where the person who gets elected president didn't actually get the majority of votes, such as when Donald Trump was elected in 2016. </p>

<h2><a href="https://www.change.org/p/bernie-sanders-disabled-workers-deserve-equal-pay-eafcd865-378c-4221-bf84-e45a71d8151d" target="_blank">Pay Disabled Workers Fairly</a></h2>
<p>There are certain laws that allow companies to severely underpay disabled workers. Disabled workers deserve the same pay as everyone else.</p>
  
<br/>

<h2><a href="https://act.colorofchange.org/sign/breonna_taylor_special_prosecutor/?sp_ref=677086674.176.211174.e.660112.2&referring_akid=47244.11532161.yAAjnr&source=em_sp" target="_blank">Assign a different prosecuter to the Breonna Taylor case</a></h2>
<p>Daniel Cameron, the current Kentucky attorney general, prevented Breonna Taylor's family from getting justice for her death. His behavior during the trial implies that he was more interested in helping the officers than he was in upholding the law.</p>
  
<br/>
  
<h2><a href="http://chng.it/NqzVVdmGLD" target="_blank">Justice for Breonna Taylor</a></h2>
<p>Breonna was murdered in her bed by plainclothesman police officers. Her case was brought to court, but her murderers were only charged for "wanton endangerment" for putting her neighbors in danger, not for killing Breonna. Breonna still needs justice.</p>

<br/>
  
<h2><a href="https://www.change.org/p/congress-require-first-responders-to-be-educated-on-dealing-with-mentally-ill" target="_blank">Train Police and First Responders to Properly Manage Disabled People</a></h2>
<p>Police and first responders frequently encounter disabled people and need to be properly trained on how to interact with them well.</p> 
  
<br/>
  
<h2><a href="https://www.change.org/p/united-states-congress-make-juneteenth-a-national-holiday-in-2020?source_location=petitions_browse" target="_blank">Make Juneteenth a National Holiday</a></h2>
<p>Juneteenth is a celebration of the end of slavery but has yet to be recognized as a national holiday.</p>
  
<br/>
  
<h2><a href="https://www.change.org/p/tony-evers-charge-the-cops-who-shot-jacob-blake" target="_blank">Justice for Jacob Blake</a></h2>
<p>Jacob was shot by a police officer seven times after walking away from them. The officers involved have yet to face consequences.</p>
  
<br/>
  
<h2><a href="http://chng.it/gqhCgNN4W4" target="_blank">Knock Down Slave Trade Center in Fayetteville, NC</a></h2>
<p>There is a market center in Fayetteville, NC that once functioned as a slave trade center. Although it has been repurposed, its history remains and it is disrespectful to the Black community in that area, validating the beliefs of people who want to bring slavery back.</p>
  
<br/>
  
<h2><a href="http://chng.it/Ym8xCwGKXs" target="_blank">Justice for Elijah McClain</a></h2>
<p>Elijah was murdered by the police after being labeled as "suspicious". His killers have yet to be convicted.</p>
  
<br/>
  
<h2><a href="http://chng.it/bR4VSGvFwc" target="_blank">Remove Belgian Law Allowing Universities to Ban Hijabs</a></h2>
<p>The Belgian Constitutional Court recently ruled that universities in the nation can ban Hijabs from their campuses. The hijab is a major part of the Muslim religion and plays an important role in their culture and beliefs.</p>
  
<br/>
  
<h2><a href="http://chng.it/B2X84XNTWf" target="_blank">Keep Community Captioning on Youtube</a></h2>
<p>Youtube is planning on removing the community's ability to make captions for videos on its platform, which would leave captioning up to creators or third parties. Creators often don't have time to caption, and third party captioning can be unnecessarily expensive. Captions make youtube videos accessible to a larger audience and many people rely on them to enjoy the website.</p>

<br/>
  
<h2><a href="http://chng.it/mK5k9vb5c6" target="_blank">Free Uyghur Muslims from Chinese Concentration Camps</a></h2>
<p>The Chinese government has been putting Uyghur Muslims in the country into concentration camps since 2017 where they are tortured, forced to eat pork/drink alcohol (which goes against their religion), and made to denounce Islam.</p>

  <br></br>
 
<h2><a href="http://chng.it/6YSjm2p4rX" target="_blank">Save the USPS</a></h2>
<p>The USPS is experiencing financial difficulties. USPS is many people's only way of sending mail to their loved ones, lawyers, and other important individuals. It also transports mail-in voting.</p>

  <br></br>
  
<h2><a href="http://chng.it/rZBgXYfPY9" target="_blank">Educate Children on Black History</a></h2>
<p>Many important aspects of Black history beyond slavery, such as the Black Wall Street, are not taught in US schools.</p>

  <br></br>
  
<h2><a href="http://chng.it/Qt7QYw42nK" target="_blank">Educate Children on Asian History</a></h2>
<p>The current treatment of Asian history in US classrooms <a href="https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ782453" target="_blank">perpetuates the model minority stereotype and the portrayal of Asian Americans as foreigners<a>.</p>

  <br></br>
  
<h2><a href="http://chng.it/d7mDBByBZR" target="_blank">Remove the DHS from Portland</a></h2>
<p>The Department of Homeland Security has been capturing protesters/rioters in Portland, Oregon and forcing them into unmarked vans. The DHS also likely plans to utilize this type of force more around the US in the future if it is not stopped.</p>

<br></br>

<h2><a href="http://chng.it/yQDY6cgHHm" target="_blank">Justice for Cornelius Fredricks</a></h2>
<p>Cornelius, a 16 year old boy, was murdered in the same way George Floyd was by the staff at a youth center because he threw a sandwich.</p>

<br></br>

<h2><a href="http://chng.it/JYNSPXVDSQ" target="_blank">Justice for Kadijah Saccoh</a></h2>
<p>Kadijah was a five year old girl who was raped, tortured, and murdered.</p>
